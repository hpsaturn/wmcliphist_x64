Some bugs are fixed in this version.\r\n\r\nCopying\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it\r\nunder the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the\r\nFree Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your\r\noption) any later version.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nIn short, it is clipboard history dockable application for Window Maker\r\n(and maybe AfterStep with some little modifications - not tested).\r\nwmcliphist keeps history of clipboard operations and allows you to put\r\npreviously copied items back to clipboard for pasting to other\r\napplications. I wrote wmcliphist because there was no such application\r\nsuitable for usage in Window Maker and I was confused to run number of\r\nKDE daemons for Klipper (which was the inspiration).\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n  * selectable number of items to keep\r\n  * detachable (tear off) menu with clipboard history\r\n  * possibility to lock item (locked items will not be overriden by new\r\n    clipboard operations). To lock item press right mouse button on it.\r\n  * saves history to file on exit (and loads it on start, of course :),\r\n    periodicaly and/or on request\r\n  * can handle binary data\r\n  * configurable hotkey support (pop up menu at mouse cursor position)\r\n  * regular expression driven actions (ignore/submenu/exec)\r\n  * possibility to lock clipboard (new selections will not replace the\r\n    current one and it could not be stored in history too)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstalation\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nwmcliphist requires gtk+ and glib (fully tested only with 1.2.8 and\r\n1.2.10, but probably will work with any 1.2.x version) and foodock\r\nlibrary for writing dockable applications based on gtk+ (included).\r\nHopefuly you'll only need to run\r\n\r\nmake all install\r\n\r\nto compile and install wmcliphist. Note that you have to be root to\r\ninstall program to /usr/local/bin (default). If it fails, check, that\r\nyou have installed gtk+, gtk+-devel, glib and glib-devel packages, make\r\nand compiler (gcc). If it still fails, try to upgrade to up to date\r\nversions of libraries listed above (see www.gtk.org).\r\nwmcliphist was tested only on Linux (Red Hat Linux 7.2, kernel 2.4.9,\r\ngcc 2.96), but it should compile and run on other un*x systems too.\r\nAfter installing binary you can create your configuration file in\r\n~/.wmcliphistrc (sample config file wmcliphistrc is included in\r\ndistribution archive).\r\n\r\nUpgrading\r\n\r\nPlease note, that upgrade from version 0.1 will delete your old history!\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 0.2 to 0.3, move your ~/.wmcliphistrc\r\nto ~/.wmcliphist.data and create new ~/.wmcliphistrc with configuration\r\n(sample config file is included).\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nwmcliphist accepts followinf options:\r\n\r\n-h         show help\r\n-n <num>   set number of items to keep (default 10)\r\n-c color   set color for locked items (default is red)\r\n-s <size>  choose wmcliphist icon size:\r\n           16 = tiny 16x16 px icon\r\n           30 = icon suitable for 32px dock/slit\r\n           40 = icon suitable for 48px dock/slit\r\n           60 = icon suitable for 64px dock/slit (default)\r\n-i <num>   choose wmcliphist icon antialiasing:\r\n           0 = for mid tones background (default)\r\n           1 = for dark background\r\n           2 = for light background\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n/usr/local/bin/wmcliphist -n 15 -c darkgreen\r\n\r\nSome of theese options and many others can be set in ~/.wmcliphistrc too.\r\n\r\nLeft click on icon opens menu with history and right click opens\r\napplication menu. Right click on history menu item will lock it.\r\nHistory menu can be opened at mouse cursor position with configurable\r\nhotkey too.\r\n\r\n\r\nToDo\r\n----\r\n\r\n  * Maybe some configuration GUI? Who knows...\r\n  * Separated history queues\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nMichal Krause <michal (at) krause (dot) cz>\r\nDaniel Richard G. <skunk (at) iskunk (dot) org> (icon set used from version 0.5)\r\nMichael Beattie (new exec action handling in 0.6)\r\nVadim O.
