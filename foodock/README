DESCRIPTION:

libfoodock is a library for creating Gtk WindowMaker dockable applications.

void gdk_window_set_icon(main_window->window, icon_window->window, NULL, NULL);
won't do the trick. I suspect it sets up wrong WindowGroupHint.

If you create an application using gdk_window_set_icon it probably will not
useful under WindowMaker.

INSTALLATION:

make
sudo make install
(optional) make example
(optional) ./example
(optional) sudo make uninstall

Please notice that make install will copy the library into LIBPATH (see
Makefile). foodock.h will not be copied but you need this file to develop
applications using libfoodock.

PROGRAMMING:

libfoodock contains the only function:
GtkWidget *foo_create_main_icon_window(GtkWidget *mw, unsigned int s,
                                       int margc, char *margv[])

You *should* do the following:

(1) gtk_init
(2) w = gtk_window_new
(3) gtk_widget_realize(w)	! Very important !
(4) w1 = foo_create_main_icon_window(w, 56, argc, argv);
(5) gtk_widget_show(w1)
(6) gtk_main

Comments:
(2) You should create main application window. Please notice that you will not
see this window on the screen; it will be hidden. The only purpose of this
window is to provide window group.
(3) Because we will do some Xlib lowlevel tricks in
foo_create_main_icon_window, main window should be realized or 
GDK_WINDOW_XWINDOW(w->window) will fail.
(4) w1 now is pointer to gtk event box. You may think about w1 as about
GTK_CONTAINER which represent docked WindowMaker application. You can put
anything inside it. "56" is a recommended size of w1 (because standard
WindowMaker dock item is 64x64... but you can try 64 or 60 r 50 or 20...).
Please notice that w1 will be realised after foo_create_main_icon_window.
argc and argv arguments define what WindowMaker will set up after docking as a
command for launching your application.
(5) After you put anything you want into w1 you should show w1.

Please see example.c for working example.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

I should thank:

1. Owen Taylor <otaylor@redhat.com>, one of Gtk authors. He answered my request 
in Gtk mailing list: "Use the function: void gdk_window_set_icon". It allows
to understand me that there is no way to do dockable application in Gdk/Gtk
w/o Xlib (because gdk_window_set_icon doesn't help, and Gtk author didn't
recommend anything else).

2. David Raufeisen <lamer@fortyoz.org>. He answered my request in Gtk mailing
list with working code. Thanks! An idea to use event box was great.
